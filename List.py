#Today we will make our 1st list in python

# So Basically there are two methods of representin a list 


# First one is to show all the items in one line and firstly we will make code for that. So that, it will be less confusing 
Shopping = ["bread","milk","butter"]
print(Shopping) 

# The second method is to print each item one by one 
#so let's watch how can we do that
Shopping = ["bread","milk","butter"]
for item in Shopping:
  print(item)
# Here, we use for loop for to print one item in one tym
